# Loading Multiple Canvases (WASM WebGL)
## Overview
- Takes the idea of using [multiple wasm components](https://github.com/Yongbeom-Kim/emscripten-examples/tree/main/multiple-wasm-components) for multiple wasm webgl components, each having their own canvases.
- Unfortunately, canvas selectors have to be coded into the relevant cpp source files.
- WebGL code from: [here](https://blog.feather.systems/WebGL.html)
